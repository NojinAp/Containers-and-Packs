# Containers-and-Packs
This object-oriented program works with containers, as well as packs which are inherited from containers. This contains adding and removing their content volume, as long as they are not full and not empty. If the content description is null or the content volume exceeds the capacity, the container will be considered invalid(Broken). 
Some amounts are provided in the program as examples for testing.
